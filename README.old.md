# Backlog

Stories provide context and provide details about the general features of an app. They do not provide any implementation details. Teams should discuss which features to work on and come up with your own implementation details. you should ask questions and dig into the details with the client as you work rather than rely solely on the stories.

Additional features and challenges will be added throughout the week and you can find some information about them here as necessary. However,

Prioritize and then complete the user stories. For each story, your team should create task lists so that you can split the work and collaborate.

### Planning Resources

These resources are only intended to help you get started and are NOT required. You're free to create your own style guides and layouts, or to build upon these in any way that you like.
