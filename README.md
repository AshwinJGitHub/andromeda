# Backlog

Stories provide context and provide details about the general features of an app. They do not provide any implementation details. Teams should discuss which features to work on and come up with your own implementation details. you should ask questions and dig into the details with the client as you work rather than rely solely on the stories.

Additional features and challenges will be added throughout the week and you can find some information about them here as necessary. However,

Prioritize and then complete the user stories. For each story, your team should create task lists so that you can split the work and collaborate.

### Planning Resources

These resources are only intended to help you get started and are NOT required. You're free to create your own style guides and layouts, or to build upon these in any way that you like.

- [Style Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ec-zjSB1EXhlJW89rWyvI-hy9QJPDt8G9lX6Tt_nM9w/edit?usp=sharing) 
- [UI Layouts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wafx-638oJ1NrapmNG-RqiX1Hpc0m2m5/view?usp=sharing) 

## Personas
Personas are used to describe different types of users of your application.

Below you will find some personas of people who will be interacting with your application. Use them to help in making your decisions about the User Stories.

### **Laura**

- **Roles**: Owner of the dealership
- **Goals**: Add to her inventory of vehicles that have the best potential to make money. Keep the lot stocked with enough vehicles to sell and draw in customers.

### **Todd**

- **Roles**: Customer, User
- **Goals**: Buy new or used cars to add to his collection at the best value.

## User Stories
Prioritize and then complete these user stories. For each story, your team should create task lists so that you can collaborate to build the features.

Instructors will act as your coaches, project leads and client. So if you have any questions about the stories or the project in general, we're here to help you get answers.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
